The resulting dataset after slicing the 3D voxels contains both the images and the ground truth labels of 40 patients. Each patient has a set of 2D images that represent different slices of the 3D volume. The dataset is organized so that each patientâ€™s data is stored in a separate folder, with the images named according to their slice index.

I noticed that the viewer seems to flip the images during visualization. When I compared these to the files opened directly from the file system, they looked different, which was a bit confusing at first. Since the dataset focuses on the thoracic cavity, I found it especially interesting to look at the slices and try to recognize the vital organs in that area.
This was my first time working with CT images, so exploring them felt like a new learning experience. Another thing that stood out to me was that some of the images appeared quite dark. I think this may be because the voxels are normalized as a whole, which from what I learned is a standard approach in research and was also applied here.
